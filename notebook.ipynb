A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.\n\nThe study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.\n\nWe will explore the `students` data using PostgreSQL to find out if we would come to a similar conclusion for international students and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.\n\nHere is a data description of the columns you may find helpful.","metadata":{},"id":"dbd633ea-2c0a-4bac-a6fe-0cc86896162b","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"| Field Name    | Description                                      |\n| ------------- |

A high proficiency comes with a lower level of depression, but this level of 8.38 still fell within the range of mild depression. As an international student develops a higher level of proficiency of the Japanese language, mastering complex Kanji symbols and pronunciations, they experience less acculturative stress. This indicates that that being able to speak the native language fluently plays a vital role in succesfully adapting to the native culture.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fa131ebf-8c33-42ab-bdb9-b17d5b392d74"},{"source":"## Are older students more likely to report higher depression scores?","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"320ee202-3ad3-4f38-9533-538c3c6a5719"},{"source":"SELECT\n\tCASE\n\t\tWHEN age BETWEEN 18 AND 22 THEN '18-22'\n\t\tWHEN age BETWEEN 23 AND 27 THEN '23-27'\n\t\tWHEN age >= 28 THEN '28+'\n\t\tELSE 'Unknown'\n\t\tEND AS age_group,\n\tROUND(AVG(todep), 2) AS average_phq\nFROM students\nGROUP BY age_group\nORDER BY age_group;","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"df9","sqlCellMode":"dataFrame","sqlSource":{"integrationId":"89e17161-a224-4a8a-846b-0adc0fe7a4b1","integrationType":"postgresql","type":"integration"},"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":1095,"lastExecutedAt":1742416009718,"lastExecutedByKernel":"535cd546-9490-4a4c-9929-405dc899d9f1","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"SELECT\n\tCASE\n\t\tWHEN age BETWEEN 18 AND 22 THEN '18-22'\n\t\tWHEN age BETWEEN 23 AND 27 THEN '23-27'\n\t\tWHEN age >= 28 THEN '28+'\n\t\tELSE 'Unknown'\n\t\tEND AS age_group,\n\tROUND(AVG(todep), 2) AS average_phq\nFROM students\nGROUP BY age_group\nORDER BY age_group;","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":501,"type":"dataFrame","tableState":{"quickFilterText":"","customFilter":{"const":{"type":"boolean","valid":true,"value":true},"id":"1f8b8928-059e-463c-8ef2-7f50531c8c34","nodeType":"const"}}}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"7dd4f943-447c-47ea-b2c5-b56470b93cea","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"age_group","type":"string"},{"name":"average_phq","type":"number"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3],"age_group":["18-22","23-27","28+","Unknown"],"average_phq":[8.47,7.85,5.43,4.67]}},"total_rows":4,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"  age_group  average_phq\n0     18-22         8.47\n1     23-27         7.85\n2       28+         5.43\n3   Unknown         4.67","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>age_group</th>\n      <th>average_phq</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>18-22</td>\n      <td>8.47</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>23-27</td>\n      <td>7.85</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>28+</td>\n      <td>5.43</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>Unknown</td>\n      <td>4.67</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"status":"success"}},"execution_count":17,"@datacamp/metadata":{"executedQuery":"SELECT\n\tCASE\n\t\tWHEN age BETWEEN 18 AND 22 THEN '18-22'\n\t\tWHEN age BETWEEN 23 AND 27 THEN '23-27'\n\t\tWHEN age >= 28 THEN '28+'\n\t\tELSE 'Unknown'\n\t\tEND AS age_group,\n\tROUND(AVG(todep), 2) AS average_phq\nFROM students\nGROUP BY age_group\nORDER BY age_group;","executedQueryParameters":[]}}],"execution_count":17},{"source":"At a PHQ-9 score of 8.47, younger students face higher levels of depression symptoms on average. Most students struggle with homesickness, being unable to adapt to an unexperienced culture, and lack of friends and emotional support. As they get older and reach the ages of 23-27, the average PHQ-9 score eases to 7.85, suggesting overcoming of homesickness and a better network of emotional belongingness, which lowers mental stress and depressive symptoms. This trend persists into the middle-ages and by this time, they typically develop stable coping mechanisms and a robust network of mental support systems.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8de28c32-f6b3-4cdc-b826-a9e8719e9321"},{"source":"# Conclusion","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6d379933-60eb-473e-8ac1-ad5ea43638e7"},{"source":"The exploration of the `students` dataset using PostgreSQL revealed some interesting findings which suggested that there is a critical need to address mental health problem among young international students. The local government can focus on developing Japanese proficiency by introducing special crash courses on Japanese in their curriculum, targeted towards foreign students. They can make Japanese culture easier to integrate into by publishing informative videos, blogs and short-form content and making signs and instructions accessible to English-speaking students. These measures hold the potential to save Japan's falling birth rates as making the country's education international friendly will boost admissions and consequently, large scale immigration into Japan will help increase its birth rate. This project was essential to my understanding of grouping, filtering and aggregating functions of PostgreSQL and its usefulness in deriving useful insights from real world data.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c80e99b8-11c1-4aa3-ab28-6616e76f095f"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
